# Quake for Oculus Rift

[Download Here](https://github.com/phoboslab/Quakespasm-Rift/releases)

Based on [Quakespasm](http://quakespasm.sourceforge.net/). This enables support for the Oculus Rift CV1 in Direct Mode for idsoftware's original Quake. You need the Oculus SDK 1.9.0 and SDL to compile this.

The release version comes with a sensible `config.cfg` and `autoexec.cfg` file that enables VR Mode by default, disables view bobbing and sets the texture mode to NEAREST for the proper, pixelated oldschool vibe.

## Building:

1. Install the free Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition, if you don't already have it.

2. Go to https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/pc/1.9.0/Oculus_SDK_for_Windows/ then download and extract it NEXT TO (not in) your Quakespasm-Rift folder. So there is an "OculusSDK" folder and a "QuakeSpasm-Rift" folder side-by-side.

3. Use the VC13 solution to compile what you need:
	Quakespasm-Rift\Windows\VisualStudio\quakespasm.sln
	
4. In Visual Studio, right click project quakespasm-sdl2, click Properties. Set Configuration to All Configurations. Choose Debugging, set Working Directory to your Quake folder.

5. Run the quakespasm-sdl2 project. You need to enable VR in the game options and start a new game before it will be in VR.

## Additional cvars:
- `vr_enabled` – 0: disabled, 1: enabled
- `vr_crosshair` – 0: disabled, 1: point, 2: laser sight
- `vr_crosshair_size` - Sets the diameter of the crosshair dot/laser from 1-32 pixels wide. Default 3.
- `vr_crosshair_depth` – Projection depth for the crosshair. Use `0` to automatically project on nearest wall/entity. Default 0.
- `vr_crosshair_alpha` – Sets the opacity for the crosshair dot/laser. Default 0.25.
- `vr_aimmode` – 1: Head Aiming, 2: Head Aiming + mouse pitch, 3: Mouse aiming, 4: Mouse aiming + mouse pitch, 5: Mouse aims, with YAW decoupled for limited area, 6: Mouse aims, with YAW decoupled for limited area and pitch decoupled completely. Default 1.
- `vr_deadzone` – Deadzone in degrees for `vr_aimmode 5`. Default 30.
- `vr_perfhud`- – Show the Oculus Performance Hud (1-5). Default 0.
- `snd_device` – Search string for the audio output device to use. Default: "default". This will get set automatically to the Oculus "Rift Audio" when `vr_enabled` is 1
